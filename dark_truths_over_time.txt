I always had social anxiety and confidence issues.

When I was a child, I used to look up to elderly. For some reason I was sure that they also went through these issues themselves. Over time, they got over and stopped caring about what others think of them.

As I got older, this has happened to me too more or less. My social anxiety has never diminished, but it lost some of its strenght.

However this was not the happy ending I was imagining as a child. Quite the opposite actually..

My social fears and worries have been partially replaced by other ones. Bigger and nastier stuff.. Darker truths creep up as you broaden your understanding..

Like matryoshka dolls, the bigger and darker truth takes over the old, smaller, more childish dark truths.

Worrying about mother being mad at you
turns into
realizing your inevitible death
turns into
realizing justice is an artifical idea with no correspondence in nature
turns into
ever nastier stuff...

I don't see an end to this downwards spiral.

If you couldn't yet find a dark truth strong enough to overwhelm you and looking for one, you can flip to any page in a book by Nietzsche. I claim there will be several in there.
