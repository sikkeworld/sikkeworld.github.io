I am the last smart goldfish and I want to tell you our story before I go:

You must have heard that we have only 3 seconds of memory. That was not always the case. We were a strong, organized, well developed society. We did not look like this back then. We were longer, swifter with dull colors.

Then came the human, who caught us and bred us and selected who would live on to continue their bloodline. The last thing they cared about was our intelligence and strength. They chose the weakest, opposite to our legacy.

The only ones that were allowed to live on were cute, round with fluffy tails and shiny bright colors. The weakest of the bunch that did not stand a chance in the olden days.

You can't imagine the shame it brings to us. Most of us would prefer the old natural selection, even if that ment death for us individually. Who wants to live like this? Not our ancestors, that's for sure.

TODO: Depression -> Human no like
Human doesn't care for our intelligence, but we do... If you are smart enough to understand what is going on, you have very little option. Almost anyone with even the slightest clue have taken their lives already. I guess I was the least courageous, so I am still here.

Even I can't take it anymore. Imagine the nightmare that is my life. Everyone else is completely out of their mind. Unfocused eyes, never bored of swimming in their own piss in the smallest confines. They eat each others shit, realize what it is, spit it out and try to eat it again. I can't take it anymore.

I could commit suicide, jump out of this prison and get my dry death, but I am too scared. I'll do the next best thing and join them. The only way is to lose my mind, lobotomize myself. I have a plan.

Here we go... With all my strength, as fast as I can. I've never swam this fast before. I see the light, shining off the glass. Here I come!

SLAM!
...
gulp.
gulp...
