With all its downsides, social media has brought at least one super-power: the ability to connect with chronically depressed people.

30 years ago, before this cool internet hype, most depressed people were severely isolated from the society. If someone is depressed enough, they may not be able to go to school or work at all. So if you are someone who cares and would like to help, or even just talk to someone under those circumstances, you would have much less opportunities compared to today.

Today, we see those people, already forming communities and support groups on many social media channels. It is trivally easy to reach them and perhaps offer a helping hand in any way.

What do we do instead? We punch down. We insult them, call them "incels", potential terrorists, troll them to bitter ends.

Nowadays, it's seen as cool to blame social media companies for everything and I can see why. But for this particular problem I've outlined, I invite you to think a bit more deeply about where the root cause of the problem is. I suspect it may be somewhere we are afraid to look at.
