  <h1>It's time to give back Nigeria!</h1>
  <p>The story that I am about to tell you is a real one.</p>
  <p>It contains some illegal activities by me and my friends.</p>
  <p>So I will be vague on some details on purpose.</p>
  <p>One of my friends is an artist.</p>
  <p>They sell many kinds of art items thorughout the world.</p>
  <p>(It turns out U.S.A. is always the top buyer. U.S.A. is good shit.)</p>
  <p>As they ship to most countries around the world,</p>
  <p>they had their fair share of issues with the postal services and</p>
  <p>have learned the ins and outs of them pretty well.</p>
  <p>Did you know that posts get lost all the time?</p>
  <p>That leads to an insurance system.</p>
  <p>My hacker mind automatically searched for a crack in the system.</p>
  <p>I asked them to learn more about the insurance protection systems.</p>
  <p>Example; what happens if I declare that my lost post costed a million dolars?</p>
  <p>Will they actually pay me a million?</p>
  <p>Probably not, so they'll try to prove the post is worth less.</p>
  <p>How can they do that though?</p>
  <p>It is art after all! Weird shit can earn sick shit, who is to say?</p>
  <p>So the only venue they have is to ask for proof of payment.</p>
  <p>If someone has actually paid me a million dollars for their order,</p>
  <p>how can they argue it is actually worth less?</p>
  <p>Hardly anyone sees the postal service as the ultimate judgement on the value of art.</p>
  <p>So I'm thinking:</p>
  <p>If someone pays me a million dollars, I can pay them back immedeatly, no issue there.</p>
  <p>Then I'll send them an empty box, hoping it will get lost.</p>
  <p>Then claim the lost box had a photo in it worth a million.</p>
  <p>Nice plan right?</p>
  <p>So we thought.</p>
  <p>Confidently, we began by taking a bank loan with a huge interest rate.</p>
  <p>"What could possibly go wrong?"</p>
  <p>We have sent money between each other, just for the official receipt proof.</p>
  <p>Then we started to send empty boxes throughout the county.</p>
  <p>As long as the shipment is within the country where the payment came from,</p>
  <p>we should be fine...</p>
  <p>Then we ran into a problem.</p>
  <p>No packages were ever getting lost!</p>
  <p>Fuck my luck, I am born into a first world country with reliable postal service.</p>
  <p>After a month of trials, we gave up.</p>
  <p>At this point we are already in debt due to bank interest.</p>
  <p>We decided to be rational minded and checked the statistics.</p>
  <p>It turns out, the country where it is most likely to lose your post is...</p>
  <p>Drum rolls please...</p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>Nigeria!</p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>So we need someone from Nigerea to send us a million...</p>
  <p>I am sorry to admit that I know noone from Africa, let alone Nigeria.</p>
  <p>Our last resort was to spam Nigeran folks.</p>
  <p>So we bought a Nigerian mail list from some hackers.</p>
  <p>(related: sunken cost fallacy)</p>
  <p>We sent out our spam:</p>
  <p><i>It is time to give back Nigeria!</i></p>
  <p><i>For many years you have been phising the western us.</i></p>
  <p><i>For too many years we have stood by and let you do your thing to our confused elderly.</i></p>
  <p><i>A debt has to be settled.</i></p>
  <p><i>We have a great business opportunity for you.</i></p>
  <p><i>Please send us your bank details.</i></p>
  <p><i>We will send you a million dollars.</i></p>
  <p><i>All you need to is to send it back.</i></p>
  <p><i>You will keep 10 dollars for yourselves.</i></p>
  <p><i>I think it is a fair deal.</i></p>
  <p><i>First come, first serve!</i></p>
  <p><i>Thanks in advance!</i></p>
  <p>After two years, no answers yet.</p>
  <p>Still waiting though.</p>
  <p>In the end we had to settle for a loss of tens of thousands.</p>
  <p>gg.</p>
