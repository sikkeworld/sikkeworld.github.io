  <h1>It's time to give back Nigeria!</h1>
  <p>The story that I am about to tell you is a real one.</p>
  <p>It contains some illegal activities by me and my friends.</p>
  <p>So I will be vague on some details on purpose.</p>
  <p>One of my friends is an artist.</p>
  <p>They sell many kinds of art items thorughout the world.</p>
  <p>(It turns out U.S.A. is always the top buyer. U.S.A. is good shit.)</p>
  <p>As they ship to most countries around the world,</p>
  <p>they had their fair share of issues with the postal services and</p>
  <p>have learned the ins and outs of them pretty well.</p>
  <p>Did you know that posts get lost all the time?</p>
  <p>That leads to an insurance system.</p>
  <p>My hacker mind automatically searched for a crack in the system.</p>
  <p>I asked them to learn more about the insurance protection systems.</p>
  <p>Example; what happens if I declare that my lost post costed a million dolars?</p>
  <p>Will they actually pay me a million?</p>
  <p>Probably not, so they'll try to prove the post is worth less.</p>
  <p>How can they do that though?</p>
  <p>It is art after all! Weird shit can earn sick shit, who is to say?</p>
  <p>So the only venue they have is to ask for proof of payment.</p>
  <p>If someone has actually paid me a million dollars for their order,</p>
  <p>how can they argue it is actually worth less?</p>
  <p>Hardly anyone sees the postal service as the ultimate judgement on the value of art.</p>
  <p>So I'm thinking:</p>
  <p>If someone pays me a million dollars, I can pay them back immedeatly, no issue there.</p>
  <p>Then I'll send them an empty box, hoping it will get lost.</p>
  <p>Then claim the lost box had a photo in it worth a million.</p>
  <p>Nice plan right?</p>
  <p>So we thought.</p>
  <p>Confidently, we began by taking a bank loan with a huge interest rate.</p>
  <p>"What could possibly go wrong?"</p>
  <p></p>
